A pure Rust TUI for making, using, and sharing flash cards. Flash aims to be a simplistic and useful study tool. This is my first major project in Rust and any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Happy studying!

## Installation 
Currently, Flash can only be installed via cargo using the command, 

### Cargo
First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (using the recommended `rustup` installation method) and then

```bash
cargo install flash-client
```

This method will build the binary from source.

To update, run the same command again.

## Usage
Simply run the binary `flash-client`.
