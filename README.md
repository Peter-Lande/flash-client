# flash-client

 A CLI for making, using, and sharing flash cards.

 ### TODO
 
1. Create Deck struct that is a boxed slice of Card. 
2. Implement the DeckViewer state to show the current deck one card at a time.
3. Add ability to see parts of the card based on the state of the card (maybe a stateful widget?)
